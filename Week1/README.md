# AI-Assisted Hello World

## Language Choice
I chose Python because I am comfortable with it and it is widely used for scripting and automation.

## AI Tool Used
I used ChatGPT to assist with coding.

## The AI Experience
Here's how I used the AI tool and what I discovered:

- **What worked well:**
  - Generating function structures
  - Handling user input validation
  - Formatting date and time output

- **What didn't work well:**
  - Initially, it suggested a long and complex error-handling method
  - It added unnecessary features that I later removed

- **Modifications I made:**
  - Simplified error handling for invalid input
  - Made the function more concise by stripping extra whitespace

## What I Learned
This exercise helped me understand how AI can assist in writing boilerplate code and generating useful suggestions. However, I also learned that reviewing and refining AI-generated code is crucial to keep it efficient and readable.
