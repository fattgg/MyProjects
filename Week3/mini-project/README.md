AI-Assisted Testing - Week 3 Assignment

Overview

This project demonstrates my experience using AI tools to generate tests for a simple REST API. The Product Catalog API provided a great opportunity to explore AI-assisted unit and integration testing while implementing best practices and continuous integration.

My Experience

I successfully leveraged AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to write comprehensive test suites, improving test coverage and efficiency. Throughout this process, I refined AI-generated tests, addressed edge cases, and optimized testing strategies.

What I Did

Implemented Unit Tests: Used AI to generate and refine unit tests for the product service.

Developed Integration Tests: Created test cases for all API endpoints to ensure correct functionality.

Set Up GitHub Actions: Configured continuous integration to automate test execution on GitHub.

Documented the Process: Wrote a detailed TESTING.md outlining AI tools used, challenges faced, and improvements made.

Key Learnings

AI is a powerful tool for test generation but requires human refinement to handle edge cases effectively.

Effective prompt engineering is crucial for getting useful AI-generated code.

Automation with GitHub Actions improves workflow efficiency and test reliability.

Challenges & Solutions

Incomplete AI-Generated Tests: AI sometimes missed edge cases, so I manually reviewed and enhanced them.

Prompt Refinement: I adjusted my prompts to get more precise and relevant test cases.

Workflow Optimization: Ensured tests ran smoothly in CI/CD by debugging GitHub Actions configurations.

Final Thoughts

This project deepened my understanding of AI-assisted testing and continuous integration. By combining AI tools with manual optimizations, I successfully created a robust testing framework for the Product Catalog API.
