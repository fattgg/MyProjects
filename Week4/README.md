### **Critical User Flow: Placing an Order**
1. User adds items to cart ‚Üí **Shopping Cart Service**
2. User proceeds to checkout ‚Üí **Order Service**
3. **Order Service** requests stock reservation ‚Üí **Inventory Service**
4. **Inventory Service** updates stock & confirms availability
5. **Order Service** requests payment ‚Üí **Payment Service**
6. **Payment Service** processes transaction
   - **Success**: Payment confirmed ‚Üí Order marked as completed ‚Üí **Shipping Service** notified
   - **Failure**: Order canceled ‚Üí Stock released ‚Üí **User notified**
7. **Shipping Service** assigns tracking number
8. **Notification Service** sends order confirmation & updates

### **Failure Scenarios & Solutions**

| **Potential Failure**        | **Mitigation Strategy**                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Inventory Service down  | Circuit breaker, cache stock estimates          |
| Payment failure        | Saga pattern for rollback transactions           |
| Slow service response  | Asynchronous processing, event-driven design    |
| Overloaded Notification Service | Distributed queues, retry mechanisms |

## üñ•Ô∏è 3. Architecture Diagram
### **Components**
- **API Gateway** (Handles authentication & request routing)
- **Microservices:**
  - **User, Product, Inventory, Cart, Order, Payment, Shipping, Notification, Review, Search Services**
- **External APIs** (Payment Gateway, Shipping Provider)

### **Data Flow**
- **REST (Synchronous):** User authentication, cart operations, product retrieval
- **Event-Driven (Asynchronous):** Order processing, inventory updates, notifications

### **Tools for Diagramming**
You can visualize the architecture using:
- **[Draw.io](https://www.diagrams.net/)**
- **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**
- **[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)**
- **Whiteboard/Paper** (for quick drafts before finalizing)

Hands-on Exercise: Designing a Microservice System
Overview
In this hands-on exercise, you'll work in small groups to design a microservice architecture for an e-commerce application. The goal is to apply the principles of microservices design that we've discussed in the lecture.
Ôªø
Time Allocation: 50 minutes
Group formation: 5 minutes
Design work: 30 minutes
Preparation for presentations: 5 minutes
Group presentations: 10 minutes (2-3 minutes per group)
Exercise Details
Scenario: E-Shop Application
You are tasked with redesigning a monolithic e-commerce application into a microservices architecture. The current monolith includes:
Ôªø
User registration and authentication
Product catalog with search functionality
Shopping cart management
Order processing
Payment handling
Inventory management
Shipping/delivery tracking
Customer reviews and ratings
Email notifications
Task 1: Service Identification (15 minutes)
Break down the monolith into logical microservices
For each service, define:
Its primary responsibility/business capability
The data it needs to own
Key operations it should perform
Task 2: Service Interactions (15 minutes)
Identify how services will communicate with each other
Determine which communication patterns to use:
Synchronous (REST, gRPC)
Asynchronous (message queue, event bus)
Map the critical paths for key user journeys (e.g., placing an order)
Identify potential bottlenecks or failure points
Task 3: Architecture Diagram (10 minutes)
Create a simple diagram showing:
Ôªø
All microservices in your design
Communication paths between services
Databases or data stores
External integrations (payment gateways, shipping providers, etc.)
You can use any diagramming method:
Ôªø
Draw on paper/whiteboard
Use a digital tool (draw.io, Lucidchart, etc.)
Create a text-based representation
Deliverables
Each group should prepare:
Ôªø
A list of identified microservices with brief descriptions
An architecture diagram showing service relationships
A brief explanation of key design decisions (2-3 minutes presentation)
Evaluation Criteria
Appropriate service boundaries based on business capabilities
Clear ownership of data by each service
Sensible communication patterns
Consideration of failure scenarios
Overall feasibility of the design
Example Services to Consider
User Service
Product Catalog Service
Inventory Service
Order Service
Payment Service
Shipping Service
Notification Service
Review/Rating Service
Search Service
Analytics Service
Tips for Success
Focus on business capabilities when defining services
Keep services focused and cohesive (single responsibility)
Think about data ownership - which service should be the source of truth?
Consider how to handle transactions that span multiple services
Remember that microservices add distributed systems complexity
After the Exercise
We'll have a brief presentation from each group, followed by questions and discussions about the different approaches taken. We'll analyze the trade-offs in various designs and identify common patterns that emerged.
